"""
You have to create a main course and a dessert at an Italian and a French restaurant, but you won't mix
 one cuisine with the other.

Your task is:

1) define a class Product with an abstract method cook().
This class would be base class for the next classes:

- class FettuccineAlfredo with field name ("Fettuccine Alfredo"), method cook()
provides an output of the formatted string "Italian main course prepared: " and name of the dish;

 - class Tiramisu, with field name ("Tiramisu"), method cook() provides an output of the
 formatted string "Italian dessert prepared:" and name of the dish;

- class DuckALOrange, with field name ("Duck À L'Orange"), method cook() provides an
 output of the formatted string "French main course prepared: " and name of the dish;

- class CremeBrulee,  with field name ("Crème brûlée"), method cook() provides an output
of the formatted string "French dessert prepared: " and name of the dish.

2) define a class Factory with an abstract method get_dish() that takes  type_of_meal as a
 parameter. This class would be base class for the classes ItalianDishesFactory and
  FrenchDishesFactory. The method get_dish() according to type_of_meal ("main" or "dessert")
  invokes the dish of appropriate cousine;

3) define a class FactoryProducer with the method get_factory(). The method takes the parameter
 type_of_factory and invokes the appropriate dishes factory (classes ItalianDishesFactory or FrenchDishesFactory).
